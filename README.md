# .files
Configurations, Packages and scripts for my ArchLinux Installation

As I moved from Antergos to 'from the scratch' Archlinux install I decided to keep track of my dotfiles and packages, also I pretend to create some scripts to facilitate future installations of my Arch.

Feel free to use any .files from here, I just abdicate any responsibility for your use.

# OS
Right now I am using Archlinux, Kernel 5.2 with KDE Plasma 5.x

## This is and will always be a work in progress..
